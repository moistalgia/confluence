## TECHNICAL CONFLUENCE ANALYSIS

### Multi-timeframe Alignment
**BEARISH CONVERGENCE ACROSS ALL TIMEFRAMES**
- **Weekly**: Primary downtrend intact, no reversal signals
- **Daily**: Lower highs pattern established, momentum deteriorating  
- **4H**: Break below key support confluence, volume declining
- **1H**: Bearish flag completion, immediate downside pressure

**Confluence Score: 0/100** indicates **NO conflicting signals** - rare alignment for high-probability directional trade.

### Volume Profile Significance
**CRITICAL INSTITUTIONAL LEVELS**:
- **Point of Control**: $115,604 (Major resistance overhead)
- **Value Area**: $109,360 - $123,929 (70% volume zone)
- **Current Position**: Below POC = **Institutional selling pressure**

**Market Implication**: Price rejection from POC level confirms institutions are distributing positions. The 4.7% gap below POC represents a **liquidity void** - typical precursor to accelerated moves.

### Key Support/Resistance Analysis
**PRIMARY RESISTANCE**: $115,604 (POC) - **DO NOT FADE**
- Highest volume traded level
- Multiple failed reclaim attempts expected
- 2,707 total volume concentrated here

**CRITICAL SUPPORT**: $109,360 (Value Area Low)
- First major volume support
- 5.4% downside target from current price
- Break below = acceleration to next volume cluster

### Market Structure Assessment
**CURRENT PHASE**: **Distribution/Markdown**
- Below institutional equilibrium (POC)
- Balanced market transitioning to trending
- Low liquidity rating confirms thin order book

## INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE

### Volume-Based Strategy
**SMART MONEY POSITIONING**:
- Institutions distributed heavily at $115,604 POC level
- Current price action shows **absorption exhaustion**
- Volume profile reveals **no significant buying interest** until $109,360

**Professional Insight**: The 2,707 volume concentration at POC with current price 4.7% below indicates completed institutional distribution. Smart money has rotated out of long positions.

### High-Probability Zones
